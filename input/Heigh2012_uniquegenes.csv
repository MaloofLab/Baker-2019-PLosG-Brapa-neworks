Mutants exhibit parthenogenetic development that includes proliferation of unfertilized endosperm and embryos. In heterozygous plants 50% of embryos abort. Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA. This activation is mediated by MSI1/RBR1 mediated repression of MET1.",84.091,176,28,0,73,248,274,449,3.28e-48,192
