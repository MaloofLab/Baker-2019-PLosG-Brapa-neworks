Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA.

It functions as an active repressor of the Spo minimal promoter (derived from a gene for sweet potato sporamin A1) through the EAR motif. It contains a plant-specific B3 DNA-binding domain. The Arabidopsis genome contains 42 genes with B3 domains which could be classified into three families that are represented by ABI3, ARF1 and RAV1. HSI2 belongs to the ABI3 family. It is expressed at similar levels in all organs. Treatment with 6% sucrose showed a slight increase in transcript levels after 24 h. No changes were observed after treatment with 50M ABA. It is localized in the nucleus via a nuclear localization sequence located in the fourth conserved region of the C-terminal B3 domain.",80.192,2297,327,18,564,2802,2227,1,0,2125

Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA.

It functions as an active repressor of the Spo minimal promoter (derived from a gene for sweet potato sporamin A1) through the EAR motif. It contains a plant-specific B3 DNA-binding domain. The Arabidopsis genome contains 42 genes with B3 domains which could be classified into three families that are represented by ABI3, ARF1 and RAV1. HSI2 belongs to the ABI3 family. It is expressed at similar levels in all organs. Treatment with 6% sucrose showed a slight increase in transcript levels after 24 h. No changes were observed after treatment with 50M ABA. It is localized in the nucleus via a nuclear localization sequence located in the fourth conserved region of the C-terminal B3 domain.",80.192,2297,327,18,564,2802,2227,1,0,2125
